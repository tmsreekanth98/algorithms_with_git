# Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped
if they are not in order.
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.

### Input Format
First line contains the number of elements in the array.
Second line contains the elements of the array.

### Output Format
Output of one line containing sorted array


### Sample Input
```
8
30 52 29 87 63 27 19 54
```

### Sample Output
```
19 27 29 30 52 54 63 87
```
### Implemented in:
- [Python](Bubble_Sort.py)
- [C++] (bubble_sort.cpp)
